## Find the song

This is a repo containing all of my Spotify listening history in 10 (seemingly randomly ordered) JSON files.

In that history, there is a song:

1. It's electronica and ~140bpm in nature.
2. It has a thrumming bass on a once-per-beat.
3. It contains a piano doing arpeggio riffs.
4. There are no vocals.
5. I have listened to this song more than once.

I do not know what the song is.

This repo contains my attempt to find the song.

Can you help me track it down?
